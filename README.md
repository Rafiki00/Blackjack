# Blackjack

This is a simple terminal game created using Python. It is designed for a single player against a dealer. 
The player can decide how much budget he wants to allocate to the game and how much he wants to bet.
After a round is completed the user can continue to play with his or her existing budget, reset the budget or quit.

I decided to create this game principally using a class called Game that has various methods that represent the various turns that the game has.
I added two functions, NewGame and PlayAgain to initialize the game and to add the option to start again.

Comments welcome.
